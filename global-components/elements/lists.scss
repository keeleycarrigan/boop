  These lists are built using custom counters and normal list style
  symbols so that we can achieve the specific amount of spacing between
  the symbol and text. Also, when using "list-position: inside" which is
  default and necessary for multiline list items it's the only way to be
  sure that the symbol lines up with other content.
